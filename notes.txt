Touch is a quick and easy way to create a file. 
One can then open said file in an editor, such as nano. 
If you need to move or rename a file, simply use the 'mv' command. 
Renaming is simplying 'moving' a file to the same directory, but under a new name.
If you wish to copy a file to a new location, you can use 'cp' in a similar fashion
as 'mv'.
Removal of files and directories can be done with the 'rm' and 'rmdir' commands.
