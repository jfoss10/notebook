To add files into your git repository it can be as simple as creating or modifying the file, running the 
'git add' command with your file, and finally running 'git commit'. You can add a message to the commit
by providing the '-m' flag followed by your message string. It is important to note that Git only looks at
files, not directories. Empty directories will be ignored. To avoid this you can add a file such as '.gitkeep'
to maintain file structures.
